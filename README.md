# set-color.js
set-color.js - This tool can accept color expressed in all web formats (rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsla) in a variety of formats (array, object, string/css expression) and perform conversions to other formats. Current version does not support conversion of alpha transparency values to non alpha transparencies. Future versions will provide settings to fill in this gap via 2 strategies: (a) ignore alpha transparency OR (b) compute foreground color with alpha transparency based on a background color.
